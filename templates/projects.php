<p>ChuChu is not the only project of mine. Any others will be listed on this page, and accompanied by links to pages of their own, should such pages exist.</p>
<h3>Works in Progress</h3>

		<h4>Bootstrap Version of This Site</h4>
		<p>Although I like how this site looks now, it is incompatible with Internet Explorer and some older mobile browsers, both of which many people still use. Eventually it will use a custom front-end, but to save time will first be re-written to use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Completed Projects</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4><a href="http://micro-precision.com">MicroPrecision Inc.'s Website</a></h4>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Flexbox Version of This Site</h4>
		<p>This site makes use of Flexboxes and as such may not properly display in some browsers. This will be changed in the future.</p>
