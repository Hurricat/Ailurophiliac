	<p>ChuChu is a simple Discord bot written in Python 3.5. One of the servers using it had multiple bots in the past, whose command syntaxes would sometimes be similar and cause seperate commands to be run by different bots. ChuChu was created to bring some of their functionality into one bot, so not as many would be needed in that server. Its secondary purpose is to check the server status for an old online game, as it is also used in a server for said game.</p>
	<p>This site provides documentation on ChuChu's commands, as well as updates on the bot's status and features. To add ChuChu to your own server, please <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=192780916710572032&scope=bot">click here</a>.</p>
